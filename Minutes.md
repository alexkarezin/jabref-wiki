# Next TelCo

- Sorting and Output Format: Fix rules vs. only format what has changed
- Licensing
- install4j: jre bundle download over jabref.org; oracle license of bundling jre
- We release 2.80 on the 12th anniversary on 29 November
- spin.jar: remove now or with transition to JavaFX?
- 3 vs 2.80 because we break so much?
- Format whole code according to the new formatting rules
- Status 2.11: Waiting for translation of About dialogs. Release scheduled on November, 5th.
- CircleCI: Automatically run generate-authors.sh and generate-developers.sh? (with `|| exit 0`)
- Highlight vs Pinning for marked entries (see preferences -> entry table -> float marked entries ...)
- must be implemented "vernÃ¼nftig (matthias)" "Entry table -> fit table horizontally ...."
- Ensure consistency of "file linking" actions - see also https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/190
- Remove gitter?
- XMLUtil.main -> CLI strategy (see [#266](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/266))
- New default setting for `Use native file dialog`: `Yes`? Should we remove that option completely?
- UI Improvement: Default: Web search should be opened and "DOI to BibTeX" (or "ISBN to BibTeX") should be selected as default. (refs: handling of minor issues)
