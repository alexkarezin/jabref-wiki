# Next TelCo
- Licensing
- jabref.org
- must be implemented "vernünftig (matthias)" "Entry table -> fit table horizontally ...."
- Ensure consistency of "file linking" actions - see also https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/190
  - Solution: Remove icon on the left; Remove "Download"; Auto: if not found, say "not found. please input URL <input field>. [OK] [CANCEL]"; 
- XMPUtil.main -> CLI strategy (see [#266](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/266))
- Fetchers/Web Search:
  - Distinguish between simple "fetch by key" and free keyword search? Different menu items?
  - UI Improvement: Default: Web search should be opened and "DOI to BibTeX" (or "ISBN to BibTeX") should be selected as default. (refs: handling of minor issues)
- How do we treat http://www.nature.com/news/eight-ways-to-clean-a-digital-library-1.18695 ?

# 2015-11-10
- Next version: 3.0
  - Yes
- ~~Remove Gitter~~
- install4j: jre bundle download over jabref.org; oracle license of bundling jre
  - It is allowed to bundle and distribute. Use with jabref.org. Maybe use for 3.0?
- We release 3.0 on the 12th anniversary on 29 November
  - Yes. Create branch on 20.11. for jabref-3.0
- ~~CircleCI: Automatically run generate-authors.sh? No, must be done manually for consistency reasons.~~
- Format whole code according to the new formatting rules? 
  - No, because of `git blame`
- Sorting and Output Format: Fix rules vs. only format what has changed
  - Use standard format for new things, keep existing format
  - Sorting Strategy of Entries: change as little as possible on load/save-cycle; no sort; insert on new entries on bottom
  - New entries: write with fixed format, but for existing files use
  - Only format entry if it is changed
  - Casing for keys: only lower case
  - Casing for entry types: camel case
  - Content: do not change anything
  - Indent: = aligned on one space after longest key
  - Formatter: cleanup on load moved to separate formatter with defaults
  - Tests are required for to implement these! According to `BibtexEntryWriterTest.roundTripTest`. For each entry type and formatting option.
- spin.jar: remove now or with transition to JavaFX?
  - On transition to JavaFX
- Highlight vs Pinning for marked entries (see preferences -> entry table -> float marked entries ...)
  - Add toggle button for float on/off and move out of preferences menu
- New default setting for `Use native file dialog`: `Yes`? Should we remove that option completely?
  - native: java icon, but right-click as usual (on Mac OS X really better than our dialog)
  - our dialog: jabref icon, but right-click only our options
  - (Windows) sieht sonst ziemlich gleich aus
  - native always on without option
- Translations: switch to pull requests
  - olly asks @mlep
- SourceForge Tracker: Close/Make ready-only
  - is already read only
- Pull requests: Codecov auf geforktem Repo? --> Wie können die Studis sehen, ob sie alles "erwischt" haben?
  - EclEmma in Eclipse or simply in IntelliJ IDEA
- Search #164 and #104
  - Also https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/162 ?
  - Remove incremental, filter, always live on, select matches, autocomplete always on
