This page lists how we intend to use the donations:

* [JabCon](http://jabcon.jabref.org)
* Design of new icons for [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/). See [#260](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/260) for a discussion
* Payment of developers for adding features. See [How to proceed with the development of the Docear4LibreOffice add-on](http://www.docear.org/2014/10/23/how-to-proceed-with-the-development-of-the-docear4libreoffice-add-on/) for a similar discussion.
* Coverage of food and drinks during hacking sessions

If any reader donated 5$, the developers would only have to invest their free time and not any material goods for JabRef development.

We are aware of the fees at PayPal (~5%) or flattr (~10%).
If you don't want to pay fees, ask us about our IBAN.
