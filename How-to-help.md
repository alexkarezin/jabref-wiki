Currently existing pages are:
- Deutsch: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef
- English: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef
- Español: https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef
- Français: https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef

- Svenska: https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef
- Українська: https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef
- 中文: https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef

If there is no page for you own language, you can easily create one.

## Contribute code

We follow the usual GitHub pull request approach. We have a lot of [open issues](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues). If you want to be sure to work on something the core developers currently do not handle, check the issues tagged with asking-for-a-pull-request. See our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed information and further links.

You may send a patch, but we really prefer the pull request approach of GitHub (see above). In case you want to contribute something, but git seems to be too hard for you, please get in touch with the developers to work out other ways of contributing.
