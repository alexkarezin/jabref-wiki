This page lists the persistent branches of this repository.

* [master](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/tree/master/) is the main development line
* [debian](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/tree/debian/) is used to provide a basis for the Debian package of JabRef. It removes support for other platforms such as Mac OS X and gradle plugins not required to build the jar file.
* [dev_2.11](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/tree/dev_2.11) is the branch for the outdated 2.11 development line
* [mrdlib_removal](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/tree/mrdlib_removal) is the (currently not maintained) branch for removing [Mr. DLib](http://mr-dlib.org/) functionality out of the `dev_2.11` branch as the contributors of the Mr. DLib did not provide the source of mrDlib-serialization-api.jar. Furthermore, Mr. DLib is going to be shut down in 2015, therefore this functionality is not required any more.

Other branches are used for discussing improvements with the help of pull requests.
